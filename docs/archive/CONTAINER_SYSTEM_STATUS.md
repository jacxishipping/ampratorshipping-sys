## 📋 New Models Created

### 1. ContainerExpense
```typescript
{
  containerId: string
  type: string        // "Shipping", "Customs", "Storage", etc.
  amount: number
  currency: string
  date: Date
  vendor?: string
  invoiceNumber?: string
  notes?: string
}
```

**Purpose:** Track all costs associated with container shipping

### 2. ContainerInvoice
```typescript
{
  containerId: string
  invoiceNumber: string
  amount: number
  vendor?: string
  date: Date
  dueDate?: Date
  status: InvoiceStatus
  fileUrl?: string
  notes?: string
}
```

**Purpose:** Manage invoices related to container

### 3. ContainerDocument
```typescript
{
  containerId: string
  type: string        // "BOL", "Customs", "Packing_List", "Photos"
  name: string
  fileUrl: string
  fileType: string
  fileSize: number
  uploadedBy: string
  uploadedAt: Date
  notes?: string
}
```

**Purpose:** Document management for container (BOL, customs, photos, etc.)

### 4. ContainerTrackingEvent

  newValue?: string
  metadata?: Json
  timestamp: Date
}
```

**Purpose:** Complete audit trail of all container changes

## 🔄 Relationship Changes

### Before (Current)
```
Container ──(belongs to)──> Shipment  ❌ WRONG DIRECTION
Container ──(has many)──> Item
Shipment ──(has many)──> ShipmentEvent
```

### After (New)
```
Shipment ──(belongs to)──> Container  ✅ CORRECT
Container ──(has many)──> Shipment
Container ──(has many)──> ContainerExpense
Container ──(has many)──> ContainerInvoice
Container ──(has many)──> ContainerDocument
Container ──(has many)──> ContainerTrackingEvent
Container ──(has many)──> ContainerAuditLog
```

**Item model removed** - Shipments are now directly assigned to Containers

---

## 📊 Status Workflows

### Shipment Status (Simple)
```
ON_HAND ──(assign to container)──> IN_TRANSIT
```

That's it! Only 2 statuses. Container handles the rest.

### Container Lifecycle Status
```
CREATED
  ↓
WAITING_FOR_LOADING
  ↓
LOADED
  ↓
IN_TRANSIT
  ↓
ARRIVED_PORT
  ↓
CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE
  ↓
RELEASED
  ↓
CLOSED
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This Requires Manual Action**

This is a **major breaking change** that cannot be automatically applied. You must:

### Step 1: Review Schema
```bash
# Review the new schema
cat prisma/schema-new.prisma

# Compare with current schema
diff prisma/schema.prisma prisma/schema-new.prisma
```

### Step 2: Backup Data
```bash
# Backup your entire database
pg_dump your_database > backup_before_restructure.sql

# Export current data for migration
# (You'll need to write a custom migration script)
```

### Step 3: Decision Point

**Option A: Fresh Start (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
# If you don't have critical data
rm -rf prisma/migrations
cp prisma/schema-new.prisma prisma/schema.prisma
npx prisma migrate dev --name container_restructure
```

**Option B: Migrate Data (Required for Production)**
```bash
# This requires a custom migration script
# 1. Create new tables alongside old ones
# 2. Migrate data
# 3. Drop old tables
# 4. Rename new tables

# You'll need to write this migration script based on your data
```

### Step 4: Update Code

After schema is migrated, you need to:

1. **Update API Routes** (approx. 30 files)
   - Container CRUD
   - Shipment CRUD (simplified)
   - All related endpoints

2. **Update UI Components** (approx. 20 files)
   - Container pages (new)
   - Shipment pages (simplified)
   - Forms and displays

3. **Update Cron Jobs**
   - Tracking updates for containers
   - Status cascading

4. **Update Reports**
   - Financial reports
   - Tracking reports

## 💰 Estimated Effort

| Task | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Schema Design | ✅ Done | - |
| Schema Migration | 8-16 hours | HIGH |
| API Development | 40-60 hours | HIGH |
| UI Development | 60-80 hours | HIGH |
| Testing | 20-30 hours | HIGH |
| Documentation | 10-15 hours | MEDIUM |
| Deployment | 8-12 hours | HIGH |
| **TOTAL** | **~200 hours** | - |

This is approximately **5-6 weeks** of full-time development work.

## ⚠️ Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Data Loss
**Mitigation:** Complete backup before migration, write comprehensive data migration scripts

### Risk 2: Downtime
**Mitigation:** Plan for maintenance window, have rollback plan ready

### Risk 3: API Breaking Changes
**Mitigation:** Version APIs, provide migration guide for integrations

### Risk 4: User Confusion
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation, training materials, gradual rollout

### Risk 5: Bugs in New Code
**Mitigation:** Extensive testing, staged deployment, monitor closely

## 📞 Decision Required

**You need to decide:**

1. ✅ **Approve the new schema** - Review `prisma/schema-new.prisma`
2. ✅ **Choose migration path** - Fresh start or data migration?
3. ✅ **Allocate resources** - 200 hours of development time
4. ✅ **Set timeline** - When to start and complete?
5. ✅ **Plan deployment** - How to roll out with minimal disruption?
