}

import { sendStatusUpdateEmail } from '@/lib/email';

await sendStatusUpdateEmail({
  to: 'customer@example.com',
  containerNumber: 'ABC-123',

## 🧪 Testing Email Delivery

### Test Invoice Email (Development)

You can test email delivery by generating an invoice:

3. Check the recipient's inbox

### Test Email Service Manually

Create a simple test script:

```typescript
// test-email.ts
import { sendInvoiceEmail } from './src/lib/email';

async function test() {
  const result = await sendInvoiceEmail({

    invoiceNumber: 'TEST-001',
    amount: 1234.56,
    dueDate: '2026-02-15',

  });
  
  console.log('Email result:', result);

```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limits

## 🔐 Security

**API Key Protection:**
- ✅ Stored in `.env` file
