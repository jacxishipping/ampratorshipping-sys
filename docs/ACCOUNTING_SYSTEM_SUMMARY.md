## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```
LedgerEntry
├── id (Primary Key)
├── userId (Foreign Key to User)
├── shipmentId (Foreign Key to Shipment, nullable)
├── transactionDate
├── description
├── type (DEBIT | CREDIT)
├── amount
├── balance (Running balance)
├── createdBy
├── notes
└── metadata (JSON)
```

### Transaction Flow

**Cash Payment:**
```
Shipment Created → Debit Entry → Credit Entry → Balance: 0 → Status: Paid
```

**Due Payment:**
```
Shipment Created → Debit Entry → Balance: +Amount → Status: Due
```

**Payment Recording:**
```
Payment Received → Credit Entry → Distribute to Shipments → Update Statuses → Balance: -Amount
```

### Security Model

- **Authentication**: All routes require valid session
- **Authorization**: 
  - Users: View own ledger only
  - Admins: Full access to all ledgers and operations
- **Data Integrity**: 
  - Balance recalculation on deletions
  - Transaction atomicity via Prisma transactions
  - Immutable amounts (edit description only)

## 🎓 Business Logic

### Cash Payment Logic

```typescript
IF paymentMode === 'CASH' THEN
  CREATE DEBIT entry (amount)
  CREATE CREDIT entry (amount)
  SET balance = balance + amount - amount  // Net zero
  SET shipmentStatus = 'PAID'
END IF
```

### Due Payment Logic

```typescript
IF paymentMode === 'DUE' THEN
  CREATE DEBIT entry (amount)
  SET balance = balance + amount
  SET shipmentStatus = 'PENDING'
END IF
```

### Payment Recording Logic

```typescript
RECEIVE payment (amount)
CREATE CREDIT entry (amount)
SET balance = balance - amount

FOR EACH selected shipment
  GET outstanding amount
  APPLY payment (min(payment, outstanding))
  IF outstanding <= 0 THEN
    SET shipmentStatus = 'PAID'
  END IF
END FOR
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

1. **Database Indexes**
   - userId index for fast user lookups
   - shipmentId index for shipment queries
   - transactionDate index for date range filters

2. **Pagination**
   - Default 20 entries per page
   - Configurable limit
   - Total count included

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Select only needed fields
   - Use aggregations for summaries
   - Batch operations where possible

4. **Caching Opportunities** (Future)
   - Current balance caching
   - Report caching with TTL
   - Summary statistics caching

---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication**: Next-auth session validation
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM parameterization
5. **XSS Prevention**: React automatic escaping
6. **Audit Trail**: Creator tracking on all entries
7. **Data Isolation**: Users can only see own data
